          This notice informs U.S. customers that by agreeing to these terms,
          they are consenting to resolve any dispute with ConchAI through
          binding individual arbitration, instead of going to court, with
          limited exceptions. Customers are advised to carefully review section
          16, titled "Dispute Resolution," for more information about
          arbitration.

            1. Agreement to Terms. By using our Services, you agree to be bound
            by these Terms. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, do
            not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on
            behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity,
            you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that
            entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to
            that entity.

            3. Changes to these Terms or the Services. We may update the Terms
            from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you
            know by posting the updated Terms on the Site and/or may also send
            other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms
            whenever we update them or you use the Services. If you continue to
            use the Services after we have posted updated Terms it means that
            you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound
            by the changes, you may not use the Services anymore. Because our
            Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or
            any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our
            sole discretion.

          addresses for billing and notification purposes. You confirm that you
          have the legal right to use the payment method(s) associated with your

          included in the definition of Payment Information. By subscribing, you
          agree to the pricing, payment, and billing policies, as posted or

          Subscription. By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a

          recurring payment features, and you are responsible for all recurring
          payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you
          or Conch AI. Your Subscription remains active until you cancel it, or
          we terminate your access to or use of the Services or Subscription, in
          accordance with these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>

          won't be able to cancel the purchase or receive a refund of your
          Subscription Fee at any time. In case something unexpected happens
          during the transaction, we reserve the right to cancel your
          transaction for any reason, and we'll refund any payment you've
          already made for that transaction. You can cancel your Subscription at
          any time, but please note that the cancellation will be effective at

          Subscription purchase, you won't receive a refund of any portion of
          the Subscription Fee paid for the current Subscription period at the
          time of cancellation. To cancel, please send an email to
          help@getconch.ai. You'll be responsible for all Subscription Fees
          (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) incurred for the current
          Subscription period. If you cancel, you can continue to use the

        </div>
        <p>
          (a)To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither Conch AI nor its

          lost savings, lost business opportunities, loss of data or goodwill,
          service interruption, computer damage, or system failure, or the cost
          of substitute services, arising out of or in connection with these
          Terms or the use or inability to use the Services. This applies
          whether the damages are based on warranty, contract, tort (including
          negligence), product liability, or any other legal theory, and whether
          or not Conch AI or its service providers have been advised of the
          possibility of such damages, even if a limited remedy fails of its
          essential purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) To the extent allowed by the law in the relevant jurisdiction,
          Conch AI's liability for any claims arising from or related to these
          Terms or the use of the Services shall not exceed the total amount
          paid or payable by you to Conch AI for using the Services, or one
          hundred dollars ($100) if you have not made any payment to Conch AI,
          whichever is applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE
          FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN Conch AI AND
          YOU.
        </p>
        <div className="ml-8">
          <p>
            15. Governing Law and Forum Choice. These Terms and any action
            related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act,
            federal arbitration law, and the laws of the Lithuania, without
            regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
          </p>
          <p>16. Dispute Resolution.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          All disputes, claims or controversies arising from or related to these
          Terms or the use of the Services (collectively, "Disputes") must be
          resolved through binding individual arbitration and not through a
          class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding. The
          arbitration shall be governed by the Lithuania's Federal Arbitration
          Act, and you and Conch AI waive the right to a trial by jury or to
          participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will remain
          in effect even after the termination of these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          You and Conch AI agree that any claims against each other must be
          brought only in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or
          class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
          Additionally, if the dispute is resolved through arbitration, the
          arbitrator cannot consolidate another person's claims with your
          claims, and cannot preside over any form of a representative or class
          proceeding. If a court finds this provision unenforceable, the entire
          Dispute Resolution section will be null and void.
        </p>
        <p>17. General Terms</p>
        <div className="ml-8">
          <p>
            (a) Rights Reserved. Conch AI and its licensors have sole ownership
            of all rights, titles, and interests in the Services, including any
            associated intellectual property rights. You recognize that the
            Services are safeguarded by copyright, trademark, and other laws in
            the United States and foreign countries. You promise not to remove,
            modify, or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark, or other
            proprietary rights notices that are included in or accompany the
            Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            (b) Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
            between Conch AI and you regarding the Services, and supersede all
            prior oral or written agreements or understandings between Conch AI
            and you regarding the Services. In the event that any provision of
            these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator
            or court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced
            to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions
            of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not
            assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without the
            prior written consent of Conch AI. Any attempted assignment or
            transfer without such consent will be null and void. Conch AI may
            assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without any
            restriction. These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the
            benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns,
            subject to the foregoing.
          </p>
          <p>
            (c)Under these Terms, Conch AI will provide any notices or
            communications to you through two means: (i) email, or (ii) by
            posting them on the Services. For email notices, the date of receipt
            will be considered the same day the notice is sent.
          </p>
          <p>
            (d)Conch AI's failure to enforce any right or provision of these
            Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
            Waivers of any such right or provision shall be valid only if made
            in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Conch
            AI. The exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these
            Terms shall not affect or prejudice its other remedies under these
            Terms or otherwise, unless expressly stated in these Terms.
